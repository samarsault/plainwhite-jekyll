 I am a student of Information Technology at the University of Stuttgart with a passion for sensors, AI, embedded systems, low powered devices, and consumer electronics. I have worked in health tech start-ups for 4 years in India and have experience with C, Python, and Rust programming languages. I am familiar with STM32, NXP, Linux, and Yocto. I have also written two open-source libraries for the Arduino, MCP3202, and DAC7611. Outside of work, I enjoy running, working out, hiking, tennis, football, and squash
